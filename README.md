# Monosynth

Inspired by the [Stylophone GEN X-1](https://dubreq.com/product/stylophone-gen-x-1/), this project creates a webapp
that allows you to play with a digital monosynth, powered by [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).

## [Try it out here!](https://paavanb.github.io/monosynth)
Due to nuances in the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API),
only the Chrome browser is supported at the moment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds and deploys the app to the `gh-pages` branch, which can then be pushed to update the project site.
